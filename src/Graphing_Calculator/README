Readme justifications (Week 7) for Alex and Atharva:

Alex-this week I worked on making a main menu for the graphing calculator part of the main project. I also worked on splitting Mr. M's calculator code into mvc for Calculator 2, and I guided Atharva to make a text-based Calculator UI for Calculator 2 (link to calculator 2: https://github.com/AlexH04/Calculator2-MVC--Alex-Atharva). Next ween I plan to organize the main project as mvc now that I have more experience with how it works.
  Individual block of code: src/Graphing_Calculator/GraphCubic was imported from the previous calculator project and src/Graphing_Calculator/GraphMain was coded my me this week.
  Self-grade: 4/5. I could have paid more attention to the calculator 2 minilab instead of pushing it to the end of the week; but I think I did a good job for the main portfolio assignment.
 
Atharva- This week I worked on making the text based UI for the calculator and Alex guided me on how to do so, since I have little experience with coding. Next week, I plan to contribute more to our portfolio and communicate strongly both in and out of the classroom (by using Zoom when necessary).
Individual block of code: Calculator2-MVC--Alex-Atharva/mvc-idea/src/view_control/CalculatorTextUI.java 
Self-grade: 4/5 because I could have probably communicated better this week and checked slack on a regular basis; I would only check after long periods of time, which made communication slightly harder for my teammates. I will make sure to improve on this for next week.
