//instructions for user input: say that they are doing the numerator first. Do the same process as for the polynomials, but instead of asking them to end input for the numerator, ask if they want to switch to denominator. Then the denominator process will be the same as the polynomial graphing and graph it when the user chooses to stop inputting.
